# Custom Convolutional Neural Network for CIFAR-100 Image Classification
## Introduction 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in the field of computer vision for
tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. The CIFAR-100
dataset, consisting of 60,000 images in 100 classes, presents a challenging task for deep
learning models. This assignment explores the design and implementation of a custom CNN
for image classification on the CIFAR-100 dataset. Additionally, the performance of the
custom CNN is compared with several well-established deep learning architectures: ResNet-
50, VGG-19, DenseNet-121, and EfficientNetB0. The goal is to understand the
key components of CNN architecture and evaluate their impact on model performance.
### Custom CNN Architecture
#### Architecture Design
The custom CNN architecture consists of three convolutional blocks followed by a fully
connected classification head. The following layers and techniques were used in the design:
